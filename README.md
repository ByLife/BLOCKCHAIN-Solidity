## Introduction

This is a repository for my solidity projects. I will be adding more contracts for everyone to use.

I used these contracts for the NFT project called Bored Goats. You can find it [here](https://opensea.io/collection/theboredgoatsofficial).
I made the minting contract for the NFTs and made the bulk airdrop for the buyers of the NFTs called Baby Bored Goats, you can find it [here](https://rarible.com/collection/polygon/0xc135062915f848a4fdb2a71b7fd28551d64c6c9b).
